# overview
Goal is to assign roles based on what kinds of situations I notice each of us have success in. This is mostly based on what spaces you tend to receive passes, and what kinds of throws I've noticed you are comfortable with. Roles are divided by gender so there's always 1F cutter, 1F handler, 2M cutter, 2M handler. Your role decides where you stand when we pick up a stopped disc - FMP always set up open sideline, MMP set up centre and break side.

Whichever handler is closest to the disc picks up. 

The roles are...
Cutter: Initiation (INIT), continuation (CONT), hybrid (HYBR)
Handler: break-side (BRK), centre (CNTR), open-side (OPEN)

If they force us flick we set up like this
Cutters.        INIT (M)   CONT (M)  HYBR (F)
Handlers.     BRK (M)   CNTR (M)   OPEN (F)

If backhand, like this
Cutters.        HYBR (F).    CONT (M).     INIT (M)
Handlers.     OPEN (F).    CNTR (M).     BRK (M)

# subbing and sideline
Since our positions depend on which way the force is, it is SUPER IMPORTANT for us to talk about what they're forcing, especially in the first 1 or 2 points. We should talk to each other on the sideline and shout to the people on the field so everyone knows what the force is, without calling a timeout. 

SUBBING
- for the guys, sub with your partner who has the same role. Sub off every offense so that you don't deny your partner playtime 
- for the girls, we sub in rotation as normal, but we should order ourselves so that we generally always have an FMP that can throw breaks. One of us is handler and one of us is cutter so it should be easy to communicate who stands where and does what.

# Role Principles
These roles are more like personality types or player profiles than they are explicit positions. Everyone does everything, but the role describes what you tend to do as "default". This is especially true coming out of a stopped disc, where your role defines where you stand and how you move.

### Phases of Offense
The role descriptions use terminology from the very first week when I described the phases of offense. Quick recap on what the phases of offense are:

1. **read option**: the field is nice and organized. cutters in position before the disc is picked up (or caught) and are actively cutting by stall 1
2. **chunk yardage/flow**: we've made one or more passes toward the endzone and are trying to convert that into big progress
3. **reset**: there aren't any easy passes, and people are not set up to immediately be passed to. We move the disc for as long as it takes to clean up the field and get back to read option. 

### Role explanations

Initiation cutter (MMP)
- you start breakside, but immediately set up for an under on the open side. your job is to start motion and start early. Priority is less about gaining yards and more about getting the team moving so the defense is on the back foot (although gaining yards is also very nice)
- most of your receptions will be on the open side. You are most active during read-option and chunk yardage. During reset you are using that time to get in position so that you can cut open side as soon as we're back in read-option.

Continuation cutter (MMP)
- you set up centre cutting lane. pull your defender breakside then quickly move downfield to receive a deep in the read-option. If the initiation cutter catches their pass, you will be in great position to continue momentum and gain a shit ton of yards.
- You are most active during read-option and chunk yardage. During reset, your priority is to get in good position so that once we have momentum you can resume gaining a shit ton of yards

Hybrid Cutter (FMP) 
- you are a cutter during read-option, but a handler during resets. During chunk yardage you are patient and get active as needed. You receive lots of short-mid range passes, usually on the break side. You usually throw to handlers to keep the disc on the break sideline, but will sometimes throw to other cutters to gain yards, when the opportunity comes up
- read option: start on the open side and cut toward the break side. 
	- if the disc is on the open sideline, this is mostly a clearing cut.
	- If the disc is on the break sideline, this cut is a viable option to be passed to. Make sure you cut fast so that you're not in the way of the initiating cutter when they cut under.
- chunk yardage: be patient, pull your defender away from the other cutters. Cut aggressively if your defender gets lazy
- reset: work with the handlers to get the disc break side and keep it there. Be a viable pass target to convert dumps and swings into momentum.

Breakside handler (MMP)
- you are most active during reset. You are patient and observant, using the full width of the field. You throw and receive short-medium passes to get the disc to the break side and keep it there. 
- read-option: make space, punish poaches by receiving free passes and swings
- chunk yardage: move with the play and be ready to engage as soon as we go into reset
- reset: keep the disc moving, build momentum, and gain yards until the cutters are set up for the next read-option

Centre Handler (MMP)
- your throws are mostly to the initiator during read-option. You receive reset passes from people trying to get off the open sideline. 
- since you are most likely to pick up a stopped disc, you need to be the first to identify when read-option was unsuccessful and we need to switch to reset.
- knowing when we are out of read-option and in reset is the most important skill in this role (also throwing open side unders)

Open side handler (FMP)
- our most consistent throwers. You break the mark to get the disc off the sideline, and throw to our male cutters to gain tons of yards on the open side.
- you bail out cutters who are less confident with the disc and need nice easy dump resets, especially when they are trapped on the sideline
